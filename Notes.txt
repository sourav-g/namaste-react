1. Even angular can be injected only in part of our page using id ?
 -- Possible, but since its a full-fedged framework, comes with a lot of baggage
2. Create a package and upload to npm and download and use
3. ^ vs ~ in package.json
4. Transitive dependency
5. npm - install a pkg ; npx - executing a pkg
6. what is .map files for css and js?
7. module patterns in JS - CommonJS,AMD
8. JSX is separate - not part of react
9. what is XML ?
10. Can we use JSX with Angular and others
11. Symbol in react element
12. JSX transpiled before it reaches the JS engine - done by parser-babel (as part of parcel ?),
    So without parcel, JSX will not work ???

13. JSX =babel==> React.createElement => React Element (JS Object) => HTML Element (render)
14. does babel read/parse a JS file line-by-line in sequence
15. does babel always converts JSX to React element only ??
16. any JS inside JSX - {...} . even imports ??
17. Can we create infinte loop in hTMl ( includes??)
18. JSX {..} sanitizes before executing, so Cross Site scripting attack is not possible. It uses escapes ???
19. let and const are not hoisted ???

-----------------------------------------

1. Should we start writing React components top->bottom or ground -> up ?
2. Passing a prop to a function is like passing an argument to a function. 
3. Config-driven UI
4.* When display grid vs flex ? 
5.* creating shapes using svg ? advantages of svg [https://deliciousbrains.com/svg-advantages-developers/]
6.* proposal stages in Ecmascript (stage-0,etc)
7. .js vs .jsx 
8. Config driven UI is layout or data content also ??
9. Can we have named and default export in same file ?
10. does react have 2 way binding ?
11. CORS akshay video [ what does Origin consist of ?]
12. Does React re-render entire component, even if one part is changing ? Then how is VirtualDOM and Diff algorithm is useful ?
13. useState holds changed value in memory and sets in on next re-render ?
    If only a part is being changed, then on re-render diff algorithm compares and figures out the changed part and paint only 
    that to the DOM ? -- Reconciliation
14. Why we need state variable and cannot do with normal JS variables ?
